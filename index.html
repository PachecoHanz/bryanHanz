                Gen Alpha, welcome to the meme canon. “Skibidi Toilet,” the bizarre YouTube series started by Georgian animator Alexey Gerasimov (aka DaFuq!?Boom!) in February, 
                features animated heads popping out of toilets and singing along to “Give It To Me” by Timbaland. 
                The series exploded in popularity throughout 2023 the channel now has over 36 million subscribers, 
                and many of the Skibidi Toilet videos have been viewed tens of millions of times.

                    A video of a Boston police officer taking a tumble out of a playground slide began circulating online in August, 
                    and went viral even faster than the uniformed cop shot facedown out of the metal tube. Though the clip’s origins are unclear,
                     police confirmed it was real, saying the unidentified officer had been on duty at the time and suffered minor injuries.

                <h2>Grimace Shake</h2>

                        On June 12, McDonald’s began selling the “Grimace Shake,” a berry-flavored milkshake honoring the 52nd birthday of their furry purple mascot. 
                        The shake was an instant hit… though probably not in the way McDonald’s had intended.
                         A trend emerged on TikTok in which users would taste the frozen treat, 
                         then suddenly collapse in a scene straight out of a horror movie, often convulsing as the lavender liquid spurted from their prone bodies.

                    <h2>Barbie Movie</h2>
                    <img src="images/barbie.png" alt="tiktokmeme2023" width="300">
            
                    <div style="max-width: 600px; text-align: left;">
                        <p>
                            Barbie was the unmatched star of 2023, spawning so many memes it could practically have its own list. 
                            Before the movie even came out, stills from the trailer (e.g. “Do you guys ever think about dying?”) exploded online,
                             and posters featuring the film’s cast members became a hugely riffed upon meme format.
